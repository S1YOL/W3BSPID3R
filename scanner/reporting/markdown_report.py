scanner/reporting/markdown_report.py
--------------------------------------
Generates a professional Markdown vulnerability report.

The report is structured as:
  1. Executive Summary — stats + severity breakdown table
  2. Findings — one section per vulnerability, sorted by severity
  3. Remediation Summary — consolidated fix guidance
  4. Disclaimer

Markdown was chosen as the primary human-readable format because:
  - It renders beautifully on GitHub, GitLab, and most bug-bounty platforms
  - It can be converted to PDF/HTML easily with pandoc
  - It's diff-friendly for version-controlled reports
